# machine-world-backend
A Backend I build for a freelance project. The Client needed a Web Application to manage his Inquiries, Quotations & Reports.
 - Role based Permissions were managed here.
 - Email Functionality is implemented.
 - Notifications Using Cron Job Was handled.
 - User Audits logic implemented, so that the admin could oversee what the employess did throughout the day.
 - Country, State and City masters module were introduced.
 - For Personalization, a Themesettings module implemented so that the client and can change the theme and personalize the system to his needs.
